      Establishing a healthy morning routine can set the tone for a productive and positive day. Many successful people attribute their productivity to well-structured mornings. The key is consistency and choosing habits that promote well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this guide, we'll explore practical steps to craft a morning routine that works for you, balancing physical activity, mental clarity, and nourishment.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-green-600">Step 1: Wake Up at the Same Time</h2>
    <p>
      Consistency is crucial. Waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your internal clock, improves sleep quality, and boosts your energy levels throughout the day.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-green-600">Step 2: Hydrate Immediately</h2>
    <p>
      After hours of sleep, your body is dehydrated. Drinking a glass of water right after waking helps kickstart your metabolism and flush out toxins.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-green-600">Step 3: Do Light Exercise or Stretching</h2>
    <p>
      Gentle stretching or a short walk can increase blood flow, enhance mood, and improve flexibility. Even five minutes can make a difference.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-green-600">Step 4: Eat a Healthy Breakfast</h2>
    <p>
      Fuel your body with nutrient-rich foods like fruits, whole grains, and proteins. A balanced breakfast provides energy and stabilizes blood sugar levels.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-green-600">Step 5: Set Your Intentions for the Day</h2>
    <p>
      Spend a few minutes journaling or planning your day. Clear goals and positive affirmations can increase motivation and focus.
